    <p class="subtitle">Visualizing Data for Analysis & Decision Making</p>
    <p>As a data visualization specialist with a background in data analysis, I have been "putting the data in data visualization" since 2011. Throughout my work, I empower people to more effectively use visualization to better understand whatever data is most important to them. As a consultant, I offer data visualization advising and prototyping, with a focus on creating visualizations that drive effective analysis and decision-making.</p>
    <p>As a Staff UX Engineer and Data Visualization Specialist on Google's Accelerated Science research team, I used data visualization to contribute to scientific discoveries in collaboration with scientists, ML researchers, and high-throughput computing software engineers, including research published in top-tier journal PNAS. My experience also includes developing data visualizations at the start-up Observable, creating interactive visualizations for researchers at Yale and Stanford, tracking covid in wastewater for Santa Clara county public health officials and the public, probono consuting with ACLU's data team, developing visualizations commissioned by the Dalai Lama and National Geographic, and informing the decisions made by senior executives as a data scientist at Google. My work has been published in Scientific American, and exhibited in the art museums SF Moma, Cooper Hewitt, and Ars Electronica. I have published data visualization research at <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26356927/">IEEE InfoVis</a>, and spoken at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiF4-g001EQ">OpenVis Conf</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W02ZlvulHSY">Outlier</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzXxTeQhdO0">SciPy</a> conferences.</p>

        <p>My favorite part were the bold colors. They met a scientific need: despite being close numerically, the values 0 and 1 were shown in black and bright colors, respectively, due to the scientific context that "none" and "at least 1" were conceptual opposites.</p>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W02ZlvulHSY"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanarmstrong/portfolio/master/images/outlier.png"/></a>
        <p>This talk introduces the three simple, flexible "tools" of data visualization: making color meaningful, using small multiples, and making order matter. Futhermore, it shows *why* these tools are so powerful to reveal information that might have been visible, but not noticeable or attention-grabbing. Most importantly, it demonstrates how practioners can use these principles to bring their own domain expertise or understanding of the question into their visualizations, and to make their implicit assumptions explicit.</p>

        <p>Simpson's Paradox is an extreme version of a notoriously confusing effect in which aggregate numbers seem to contradict more detailed statistics. A "comet chart" is a special type of scatterplot to reveal "changes in mix". In addition to showing the metric of interest on the y-axis, it also shows the <em>size</em> of each subgroup on the x-axis. It's immediately obvious if comets are all "streaking together", going all different directions, or if there is some correlation between where the comets are spacially and how they are changing.</p>

      <h2>Data Visualization for Science, Analysis, & Decision Making</h2>
      <p>While some data visualization specialists are focussed on effective communication and storytelling with data, much of my work is aimed at helping domain experts better use data to inform decisions or make new discoveries. For example, as a member of the <a href="https://research.google/teams/applied-science/">Google Applied Science</a> team I contributed to research on <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/unlocking-chemome-with-dna-encoded.html">drug discovery</a>, materials science, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2472555219857715">automating insight from biological images</a>, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/07/so-there-i-was-firing-megawatt-plasma.html">fusion</a>, impoving scientific computing with machine learning, and more. While I sometimes consulted on scientific communication, my focus was not about communicating results. Rather, it was about working with the scientists during the discovery and analysis process: advising, prototyping, performing viz-based analysis, and building analysis tools. Success was defined as visualizations changing the scientific decisions (which model is chosen, what experiment to perform, how to change experimental conditions, etc.), directly leading to a discovery, or using scientific data to inform a "real-world" decision.</p>

Through a series of 6 "stories" we showcase techniques that can be applied to any dataset with values measured each hour or day.</p>

        <p>When infected with a disease, we poop fragments of the viral RNA. Sampling wastewater and isolating/sequencing the extracted genes therefore provides unique insight into community-level transmission of infectious diseases, including Covid-19. Because "everybody contributes" their poop to the sewage system, tracking viral fragments in wastewater provides data that doesn't rely on individual people going to doctors to get official tests.</p>
        <p>This <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-03-21/sewage-surveillance-covid-infectious-diseases-future">LA Times article</a> demonstrates the impact that this data has already had on the decisions of public health officials and of doctors making decisions about which drugs they should use to treat patients based on which variant is predominant.<p>

        <p>The design emphasized the importance of the two features that made this dataset special: quantitative accuracy and gene expression assayed by cell type.</p>
        <p>This visualization played a role in the analysis leading to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29184206/">A multiregional proteomic survey of the postnatal human brain</a> published in Nature Neurosience</p>

        <p>My first attempt was a beautiful, interactive 3D surface. Unfortunately, it was useless for analyzing the data. Instead, these 48 line charts show 10x more data and focussed attention on the most important attributes of the data. Most importantly, the tool informed key research decisions and led to discovering an unexpected scientific phenomenon.</p>
        <p>My contributions led to being an author in scientific research published in published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the world's second most cited scientific journal.</p>

        <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.453272v1"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanarmstrong/portfolio/master/images/algae.png"></a>
        <p>A common problem in ML is understanding the interconnected relationships between 3 to 20 potential features in a dataset to identify what combinations of features most affect a "score" variable. My key data visualization insight was identifying that if we discretized the continuous score function into "bad, meh, good, better, and best" categories we could much more effectively use color and small multiples to scan the space of pairwise interactions. This was especially important in this study where the ML algorithms informed growing conditions for algae, so measuring the effectiveness of a particular set of parameters was costly and time-consuming because it required actually growing the algae in the lab.<p>

        <p>While my primary role on the Applied Sciences team was creating visualizations for analysis & discovery, I also advised researchers across the team on how to more effectively communicate their results.</p>
        <p>The "curse of knowledge" bias is especially challenging in transitioning from analysis to communication: once you know what's important about the data in the chart, it's hard to imagine that someone else looking at the same chart wouldn't see the same thing.</p>

        <p>In March or 2020, I founded and led the Data Viz Hub: a group of Googlers with data viz skills lending their expertise to projects across Google related to Covid-19. For example, our group contributed to the Google Search and News teams' visualizations of <a href="https://news.google.com/covid19/map">covid statistics</a>.</p>
        <p>Additionally, <a href="https://roadtolarissa.com/">Adam Pearce</a> and I collaborated to create  <a href="https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/answer/9825414?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927">visualizations</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/covid19-mobility/checklist/9834261?hl=en&ref_topic=9822927">thought questions</a> to contextualize the data in the Google's Community Mobility Reports.
