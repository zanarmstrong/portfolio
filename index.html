    <h1>Zan Armstrong</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Visualizing Data for Analysis & Decision Making</p>

    <p>I am a data visualization engineer, designer, and researcher. As part of <a href="https://research.google/people/106275/">Google’s Applied Sciences team</a>, I work with data analysts, scientists, and machine learning engineers to create visualizations that help them make discoveries.</p>

    <p>Previously as a freelancer I created visualizations for Yale University, Kickstarter, Google, UC Berkeley, National Geographic, and more.</p>

    <p>My work as a visualization specialist is grounded in my experience as a data scientist. In particular, I craft visualizations for analysis and decision-making where the discovery has not yet been made, but in which the creation process drives a conversation about what might be most important in the data. I create data-to-shape mappings that reveal those important features, resulting in new discoveries.</p>

        <p>The goal of this collaboration with Sean Carter, Ian Johnson, Chris Olah, and Ludwig Schubert is, essentially, to see what the AI model sees.</p>
        <p>It's not enough to look at the activations of neurons seperately, but to see combinations of neurons activating together at various levels and to reveal relationships among sets of activations (just it's not enough to know the alphabet to read, to understand written language you need to understand how the letter combine to communicate concepts).</p>

        <p>We originally created this tool for researchers at UC Berkeley to study the genetics of micro-ecosystems in the gut of an infant, the inside of a nuclear reactor, or between a dolphin's teeth. Yet, it was also embraced by the art & design community: featured in SF Moma's <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/designed-california/">Designed in California exhibit</a>, and on the cover of the member calender, and then exhibited by the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City and Cube Design museum in Kerkrade, Netherlands as part of the <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2018/11/15/cooper-hewitt-and-cube-design-museum-to-co-organize-2019-design-triennial/">2019 Design Triennial</a>.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, one of the most visually striking design decisions I made, the extreme contrast between the value 0 shown in black and the value 1 shown in near-white, was driven by the science. In most colorschemes, 0 and 1 are similar hues because 0 and 1 are numerically quite close. However, in this application, "none" and "at least 1" had completely opposite implications scientifically so they needed to look completely different.</p>

        <p>Simpson's Paradox is a notoriously confusing effect in which aggregate numbers seem to contradict more detailed statistics. A "comet chart" is a special type of scatterplot which helps analysts detect and understand this type of situation. One specific application is to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jRnI2MTChx847V0d2_NFEk9DgHAxcF8OcsG4_z6ObMQ/edit#slide=id.g1cd892e7b0_0_505">reveal changes in voting patterns</a>.</p>

        <p>Over the course of three years, I worked closely with scientists and ML experts as they built models to create new methods in the effort to find new anti-malarial drugs.</p>
        <p>Visualization played various critical roles throughout this work, from establishing a color scheme for a key concept used over the course of the project, to debugging the model, to interpreting the results. Being included as an author in the paper is a high bar, demonstrating that the work contributed not only to communicating results but also to the discoveries themselves.</p>

        <p>This dataset included *quantitative* (rather than simply qualitative) measurements of how much expression of geneswere observed in different cell types. The design was based on the importance of these two features: quantitative accuracy and various cell types.</p>

        <p>My first attempt was a beautiful 3-d interactive surface. Unfortunately, it was useless for actually understanding the data. This less "shiny" set of 48 lines charts actually showed 10x more data than the 3-d one, and led the researchers to discover a scientific phenomenon that they'd hypothesized was impossible.</p>
