        <p>The goal of this collaboration with Sean Carter, Ian Johnson, Chris Olah, and Ludwig Schubert is, essentially, to see what the AI model sees.</p>
        <p>It's not enough to look at the activations of neurons seperately, but to see combinations of neurons activating together at various levels and to reveal relationships among sets of activations (just  asit's not enough to know the alphabet in order to read; to understand written language you need to understand how letters combine to communicate concepts).</p>

        <p>We originally created this tool for researchers at UC Berkeley to study the genetics of micro-ecosystems in the gut of an infant, the inside of a nuclear reactor, or between a dolphin's teeth. Yet, it was also embraced by the art & design community: featured in SF Moma's <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/exhibition/designed-california/">Designed in California exhibit</a>, and on the cover of the member calender, and then exhibited by the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City and Cube Design museum in Kerkrade, Netherlands as part of the <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2018/11/15/cooper-hewitt-and-cube-design-museum-to-co-organize-2019-design-triennial/">2019 Design Triennial</a>.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, one of the most visually striking design decisions I made, the extreme contrast between the value 0 shown in black and the value 1 shown in near-white, was driven by the science. In most colorschemes, 0 and 1 are similar hues because 0 and 1 are numerically quite close. However, in this application, "none" and "at least 1" had completely opposite implications scientifically so they needed to look completely different.</p>

        <p>Simpson's Paradox is a notoriously confusing effect in which aggregate numbers seem to contradict more detailed statistics. A "comet chart" is a special type of scatterplot which helps analysts detect and understand this type of situation.

      <h2>Data Visualization for Science, Analysis, & Decision Making</h2>
      <p>As a member of the <a href="https://research.google/teams/applied-science/">Google Applied Science</a> team I've contributed to research on <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/unlocking-chemome-with-dna-encoded.html">drug discovery</a>, materials science, <a>automating insight from biological images</a>, <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/07/so-there-i-was-firing-megawatt-plasma.html">fusion</a>, impoving scientific computing with machine learning, and more. While I sometimes consulted on scientific communication, my focus was not about communicating results. Rather, it was about working with the scientists during the discovery and analysis process: advising, prototyping, performing vis-based analysis, and building analysis tools. Success was defined as visualizations changing the scientific decisions (what model is chosen, what experiment to perform, change experimental conditions, etc), directly leading to a discovery, or using scientific data to inform a "real-world" decision.</p>

        <p>Over the course of three years, I worked closely with scientists and ML experts as they built models to create new methods in the effort to find new anti-malarial drugs.</p>
        <p>Visualization played various critical roles throughout this work, from establishing a color scheme for a key concept used over the course of the project, to debugging the model, to interpreting the results. Being included as an author in the paper is a high bar, demonstrating that the work contributed not only to communicating results but also to the discoveries themselves.</p>

        <p>The first version was a beautiful, interactive 3-d surface. Unfortunately, it was useless for analyzing the data. This less "shiny" set of 48 lines chart shows 10x more data than the 3-d one, with each small chart represents a slice through the higher dimensional space. "User driven animation" allowed the researcher to engage more deeply with the data. Most importantly, this viz tool led to discovering an unexpected scientific phenomenon and played a key role in scientific decisions. </p>

        <p>While my primary role on the Applied Sciences team was creating visualizations for analysis & discovery, I also advised researchers across the team on how to more effectively communicate their results. The "curse of knowledge" bias is especially challenging in transitioning from making a scientific discovery to communicating that same discovery: what's important about the data is so clear to the scientist it's hard to imagine that someone else looking at the same chart for the first time wouldn't see the same thing.</p>

        <h4>Perceptual uniformity *and* distance</h4>
        <p class="author">What is the trade-off?</p>
        <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/7199ed8f71560888eb0cec6f593c5491/"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zanarmstrong/portfolio/master/images/perceptualdistance.png"/></a>
        <p>This set of charts explores the relationship between perceptual uniformity and perceptual distance for 11 common colormaps, and it illustrates an alternative way to achieve uniformity without changing the hues by "straightening" the colormap.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time I made a tiny tool for <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/05c1e95bf7aa16c4768e/">number</a> and <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/zanarmstrong/raw/ca0adb7e426c12c06a95/">date/time formatting</a>. It might also be the closest I'll ever get to being a celebrity.</p>

        <p>In 2016, there was a great debate raging in the data visualization community: storytellers vs. steppers. In this essay, I present lovely examples of storytelling, steppers, and variations on those themes from around the web to illustrate that sometimes you don't have to choose.</p>
